# Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA, Rest API

Build an Employee/Inventory CRUD API for a store dashboard using Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA and Hibernate.

[Demo application using endpoint](https://reactjs-frontend-employeestock.herokuapp.com/)

## Steps to Setup

**1. Clone the application**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmcleish91/employee-inventory-app-springboot.git
```

**2. Create Mysql database**
```bash
create database employee_info;
```
- run `src/main/resources/sql scripts/sql queries.sql`

**3. Update mysql username and password as per your installation**

+ open `src/main/resources/application.properties`
+ update `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` as per your mysql installation

**4. Run the app using maven**

```bash
